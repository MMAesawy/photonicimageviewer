# photonicimageviewer
Lightweight image viewer.

The software is an image viewer with basic functionalities such as zooming, rotation, and
mirroring around an axis. 

This is a personal hobbyist project started primarily as a way for me to learn JavaFX and
to grasp the workflow involved with making a user friendly desktop application. I've been 
looking for an image viewer that I like for such a long time that I decided I might as well
make my own and learn a thing or two along the way.

Feel free to view the code. It's mostly documentated, except for maybe the code added in the 
last few commits. I'm pretty happy with the code for the most part but I do realize it could
use some cleaning up and some method sorting, and that I needed to clearly define
a UI/backend model early on. However, the lesson was learned the hard way which is
the best way.
